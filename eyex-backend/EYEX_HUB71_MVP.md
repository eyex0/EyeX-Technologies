### Two Core Pipelines

| Pipeline            | Agents                                                                 | Purpose                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Intelligence** 🧠 | Analyst → Strategist → Decision                                        | Business analysis, strategic recommendations |
| **Engineering** 🛠️  | Planner → Researcher → Coder → Reviewer → Tester → Documenter → DevOps | Full-stack development automation            |

### Agent Count: **13 specialized agents**

---

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Intelligence Pipeline

- **Analyst Agent:** Financial metrics, trend detection, anomaly identification
- **Strategist Agent:** Strategic recommendations, risk assessment, opportunity mapping
- **Decision Agent:** Executive summaries, decision chains, confidence scoring

### 2. Company Memory System

- **5 memory layers:** conversation, long-term, agent, short-term, vector
- **Vector embeddings** for semantic search across company knowledge
- **Document understanding** with chunking and storage
- **Organization-scoped data isolation** so one company cannot see another's sessions

### 3. Decision Intelligence Demo

- Analyze → Detect patterns → Generate recommendations → Explain reasoning
- Full transparency: each agent's output and reasoning chain visible
- Deterministic fallback data ensures the demo never fails on stage

### 4. REST API

- `POST /api/v1/enterprise/demo/seed` — Seed NovaPay demo data
- `POST /api/v1/enterprise/demo/scenario` — Run a single demo step
- `POST /api/v1/enterprise/demo/run-all` — Run the full pipeline in one request
- `GET /api/v1/enterprise/demo/status/{org_id}` — Check seeded status
- `POST /api/v1/chat` — Natural-language chat with the agent graph
- `POST /api/v1/intelligence/analyze` — Submit business query
- `GET /api/v1/knowledge-graph/{org_id}` — Query company knowledge graph

## Demo Scenario: NovaPay Technologies

NovaPay is a fictional Series A fintech building real-time cross-border payments for emerging markets.

- **Funding:** $8.5M raised, $42M valuation
- **Team:** 45 employees across UAE, Kenya, India
- **Traction:** $320K monthly revenue, 18 enterprise clients, 12,500 MAU
- **Markets:** 7 operating countries
- **Demo Risks:** 4.2% monthly churn, multi-jurisdiction compliance, $180K/month burn

The demo walks investors through the exact workflow a real customer would experience.

---

## Running the Demo

1. Ensure the backend is running and `VITE_PYTHON_BACKEND_URL` points to it.
2. Log in to the frontend (Supabase auth is required).
3. Navigate to **Enterprise Demo**.
4. Click **Start Demo**.
5. Narrate each stage using `docs/HUB71_DEMO_SCRIPT.md`.

The demo is designed to complete in **60–90 seconds** and includes backend fallbacks so it remains impressive even if LLM latency spikes.

- ✅ Org/workspace-level session and memory isolation
- ✅ Memory pagination and bounded limits
- ✅ CPU-bound pipeline work moved to a thread pool
- ✅ Daily AI usage quotas (chat and intelligence endpoints)
- ✅ Full-stack GitHub Actions CI/CD with PostgreSQL and migrations
- ✅ Polished demo UI with progress bar, step timeline, and impact metrics
- ✅ Deterministic demo fallback data for reliability on stage
